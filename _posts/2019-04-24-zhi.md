As of April 24th, 2019, I have read and tracked the Chinese versions of 20 New
York Times articles. Looking at the data I have collected, I find that I frequently
have trouble identifying characters pronounced zhi (all tones).

I've marked characters pronounced *zhi* 94 times, 36%
more than the next highest pronounciation, *ji*:

Of these 94 marks, 79 come from a total of 13 (the same character can be marked more than once) characters
ranked within the top 800 most [frequently
occurring characters](http://lingua.mtsu.edu/chinese-computing/statistics/char/list.php?Which=MO)
:

| rank | entry | pinyin | marks |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
|  163 | 制    | zhì    |        3 |
|  261 | 指    | zhǐ    |        3 |
|  274 | 治    | zhì    |        1 |
|  404 | 质    | zhì    |       12 |
|  437 | 支    | zhī    |        5 |
|  524 | 致    | zhì    |       14 |
|  542 | 志    | zhì    |        6 |
|  578 | 织    | zhī    |        3 |
|  596 | 止    | zhǐ    |        5 |
|  600 | 值    | zhí    |        5 |
|  616 | 职    | zhí    |        4 |
|  677 | 置    | zhì    |        9 |
|  763 | 执    | zhí    |       12 |

Even those characters have different tones, I grouped them together because
I find tones to be the hardest part of Chinese. Because there are so many characters
in the Chinese language, when I learn a new character, I'm typically content with just knowing the pinyin
without worrying about the exact tonal inflection. This is bad.
It means I mix tones when speaking, which can lead to embarrassment. It also hurts
my reading comprehension. This character is pronounced *zhi*? Awesome. I'm not sure what it
means because a lot of characters are pronounced *zhi*, and I don't have the benefit 
of a tone to differentiate it from the rest of the heap.

So, in order to learn both the meaning of these *zhi* characters as well as their tones,
I'm doing what I always do when I want to learn something better:
I'm writing about it.

### The Characters

I'm focusing on the 5 *zhi* characters I have marked the most: 质 致 志 执 置

Conveniently, 4 of these characters are pronounced using the 4th tone. Since 
most Chinese words consist of more than one character, it is often hard to assign
single meanings to characters. Instead, I will be focusing on the common words which
contain the character, grouping them together when possible.

As an aside, I recently learned a lot about the nature of Chinese characters
, which I will touch on in a later post.

#### 置 (zhì)
install 设置, 装置, 置装, 配置[deploy/allocate]

place, to be located at 置于, 归置

comment 置评

#### 质 (zhì)
material/substance 物质, 人质[hostage], 特质[trait], 本质[nature]

quality
质量, 气质

question
质疑

#### 致 (zhì)
致 is often paired with a noun which contains the main meaning of the word.
send/deliver 致电[call], 致敬[pay tribute], 致命[lethal], 致命[fatal]

cause/incur 导致

dedication 致力

#### 志 (zhì)
will/asipration/ambition 意志, 志愿者[volunteer], 斗志[fighting]

log/record 杂志[magazine], 标志[sign], 日志

#### 执 (zhí)
hold/grasp

execute 执行, 执行官

stick to ones views 固执

law 执照[license], 执法

Here's to hoping that future data reflects a great familiarity with these 
characters.
