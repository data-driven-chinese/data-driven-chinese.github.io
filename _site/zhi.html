<h1>Character Analysis: Zhi</h1>

<p>As of April 24th, 2019, I have read and tracked the Chinese versions of 20 New
York Times articles. Looking at the data I have collected, I find that I frequently
have trouble identifying characters pronounced zhi (all tones).</p>

<p>I’ve marked characters pronounced <em>zhi</em> 94 times, 36%
more than the next highest pronounciation, <em>ji</em>:</p>

<p><img class="hsk" src="assets/img/pinyin.png" /></p>

<p>Of these 94 marks, 79 come from a total of 13 (the same character can be marked more than once) characters
ranked within the top 800 most <a href="http://lingua.mtsu.edu/chinese-computing/statistics/char/list.php?Which=MO">frequently
occurring characters</a>
:</p>

<p>Even those characters have different tones, I grouped them together because
I find tones to be the hardest part of Chinese. Because there are so many characters
in the Chinese language, when I learn a new character, I’m typically content with just knowing the pinyin
without worrying about the exact tonal inflection. This is bad.
It means I mix tones when speaking, which can lead to embarrassment. It also hurts
my reading comprehension. This character is pronounced <em>zhi</em>? Awesome. I’m not sure what it
means because a lot of characters are pronounced <em>zhi</em>, and I don’t have the benefit 
of a tone to differentiate it from the rest of the heap.</p>

<p>So, in order to learn both the meaning of these <em>zhi</em> characters as well as their tones,
I’m doing what I always do when I want to learn something better:
I’m writing about it.</p>

<h3 id="the-characters">The Characters</h3>

<p>I’m focusing on the 5 <em>zhi</em> characters I have marked the most: 质 致 志 执 置</p>

<p>Conveniently, 4 of these characters are pronounced using the 4th tone. Since 
most Chinese words consist of more than one character, it is often hard to assign
single meanings to characters. Instead, I will be focusing on the common words which
contain the character, grouping them together when possible.</p>

<p>As an aside, I recently learned a lot about the nature of Chinese characters
, which I will touch on in a later post.</p>

<p>Here’s to hoping that future data reflects a great familiarity with these 
characters.</p>
